## Project Overview

   This project visualizes data related to road accidents, focusing on various metrics such as casualties, types of vehicles involved, road types, and conditions under which 
   accidents occur.The goal is to create a visual, user-friendly dashboard that summarizes accident details,severity, weather conditions, and more. This dashboard will
   provide quick insights for informed decision-making and analysis.

## Road Casualty Insights
   The road accident data reveals 417,883 casualties, with only 1.7% (7,135) being fatal. Serious injuries accounted for 14.2% (59,312), while the vast majority—84.1% 
   (351,436)— were slight. This highlights that most accidents resulted in minor injuries, offering a positive outlook on overall accident outcomes.



## Goal
   This project aims to analyze traffic accident data and identify key trends and insights related to casualties.By doing so,the project aims to inform policy and decision- 
   making related to road safety, and ultimately help reduce the number of casualties caused by accidents.</br>
   
   Through the use of this dashboard, stakeholders can:</br>
   - Identify high-risk areas and times for road accidents.</br> 
   - Analyze the impact of different road and light conditions on accident severity.</br>
   - Develop targeted interventions to improve road safety for specific vehicle types and regions.

## Road Safety Insights & Action Plan
Analysis of casualty trends shows October and November as high-risk months. To reduce accidents, traffic police and stakeholders should step up efforts during this time.

**Focus Areas:** </br>
Car Drivers: As the largest group of casualties, drivers need targeted awareness campaigns, monitoring, and regular safety checks.

High-Risk Roads: Single carriageways are more dangerous. Add safety measures and, where possible, upgrade to double lanes to reduce accidents.

Road Surfaces: Poor road conditions contribute to accidents. Improve surfaces in high-risk areas to increase safety.

Urban Areas: Urban accidents, especially during the day, require stricter enforcement and safety programs to reduce risks.
